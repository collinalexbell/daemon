# What is a daemon

A deamon in the context of this repository is a digital guiding spirit. 

The concept here is the synergistic sum of:
the Greek Mythological daemon concept + 
the idea of a software daemon + 
the fictional class of being found in the novel trilogy _His Dark Materials_ also known as _The Golden Compass_.

## Daemon (Greek Mythology):
(δαίμων: "god", "godlike", "power", "fate") originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit such as the daimons of ancient Greek religion and mythology and of later Hellenistic religion and philosophy. The word is derived from Proto-Indo-European daimon "provider, divider (of fortunes or destinies)," from the root \*da- "to divide". Daimons were possibly seen as the souls of men of the golden age acting as tutelary deities.


## Daemon (computing): 
In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon  is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user.

## Daemon (_His Dark Materials_):
A daemon is a type of fictional being in the Philip Pullman fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials. Dæmons are the external physical manifestation of a person's "inner-self" that takes the form of an animal. Dæmons have human intelligence, are capable of human speech—regardless of the form they take—and usually behave as though they are independent of their humans.
